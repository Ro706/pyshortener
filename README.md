This is a Python code that uses three libraries:` pyshorteners, termcolor, and pyfiglet`.
pyshorteners is a Python library that shortens URLs using various URL shortening services.
termcolor is a Python library that provides an easy way to add color to your output text in the terminal.
pyfiglet is a Python library that creates ASCII art text in large letters. It takes ordinary text as input and converts it into ASCII art text.
The code you provided takes an input URL from the user and then uses the pyshorteners library to shorten it. The shortened URL is then printed in green color using the termcolor library. Finally, the pyfiglet library is used to print the text `“PyShortenerS”` in large letters.
